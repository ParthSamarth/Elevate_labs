# Hello World Python Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts including user input, variables, date handling, and terminal-based execution. It is designed to simulate a simple real-world project setup using Python and VS Code.

## Objective
- Create a Python script that prints user details
- Use variables instead of hardcoded values
- Accept user input from the terminal
- Display today’s date
- Understand program execution flow

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- VS Code
- Python Standard Library

## Python Code
Below is the complete Python program used in this project:

```python
import datetime

name = input("Enter your name: ")
role = input("Enter your internship role (e.g., Python Developer): ")

today_date = datetime.date.today()

print("\n--- Internship Details ---")
print("Name:", name)
print("Role:", role)
print("Date:", today_date)
```
